<p>Urban areas are full of possibilities to disperse sound such as their own.&lt;br&gt;
The following experiment would be worth a try: Record urban sonic phenomena. Play the recordings back to the city trough various materials, structures and forms using sound transducers. The balustrades, glass-fronts and drain pipes playing their own sounds will amplify themselves and start resonating. Soon the whole city will build up a feedback, reverberating its own score.<br>
A possible aim of this trial could be to plant a simple algorithm into the city. A small software encoded as a rhythmic sequence of sound, open for the cities' changes (since it is exposed to them). The permanent alteration would constantly trigger the self-organization of a network that organizes itself in and through alteration. A flexible future information network such as this evolves from its own crises.</p>
