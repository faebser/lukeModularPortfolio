<h1>Plain insufficiency</h1>
<p>We cut a swath through this tangled world, a straight line loophole for all intents and purposes and a straight view over this jungle that only appeared to be intangible, multidimensional, but that we knew would turn out to be flat (once we flattened it).<br>
And rasterized. Composed of precisely arranged concrete districts, subdivided by straight tarmaced lines and <a href="#seemingly_sleek">seemingly sleek</a> concrete walls. With sticky city traffic stopping and starting between blocks and buildings, a <a href="#viscous_flow">viscous flow</a> or a stream, <a href="#paketzentrum47">transport system</a>,  <a href="#networks">water system, communication or media network, power network, the world wide web</a>... diverse movements that divide and connect people. As we start listening to its rhythms, structures, bodies, vibrations, its sound, we discover that the <a href="#the_city_sounds">the city is crowded to overflowing</a> with sonic information and thus <a href="#cause_and_purpose">cause and purpose both of and for a future auditive information system</a>.<br>
As futuristic as this may sound, it is not the ever-advancing, hyper-engineered, super efficient vision of what is to come but the idea of advancing backwards and in all directions: This future is an ocean and we are navigating on it now. Going nowhere and yet getting everywhere&mdash;in circles&mdash;or is it spirals?&mdash; on our <a href="#rafts">raft made of plastic bottles</a> or as we call them: re-invented wheels.<br>
We are gambling away our time playing (cards, <a href="#ever_tried">instruments, programming, tinkering, soldering , cooking, doing stuff outdoors, listening&hellip; listening real hard&hellip; and again programming&hellip;</a>). And there is really nothing else to do, no meaningful machine to bow to and work for, just this wasteland of time. We contemplate all of our playing, about how time is all you need and unpayable, not with money at any rate.<br>
If we needed money, we'd have invented it ourselves by now. But we didn't, we invented other stuff. Things that are better <a href="#can_be_shared">shared</a> than stored and ideas that need no protection but need to be spread. We believe in the importance of being in contact with and open for others as well as ourselves, in making new and old friends, in watching slide shows together that show slides none of us know, so we can make up a whole new meaning for them, construct worlds that never existed but are based on our shared experience of watching flat pictures developed on razor-thin glass that beg for being shattered to burst into a thousand sounds, crowding it with a million perspectives, possibilities and with its chaos ever more obscuring this world we're making up.<br>
Until we decide to cut a swath through this tangled world, a straight line loophole for all intents and purposes and for a straight view over this jungle that only appeared to be intangible, multidimensional, but that we knew would turn out to be flat (once we flattened it). </p>
