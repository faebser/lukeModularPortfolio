<p>We cut a swath through this tangled world, a straight line loophole for all intents and purposes and a straight view over this jungle that only appeared to be intangible, multidimensional, but that we knew would turn out to be flat (once we flatened it). And rasterized. Composed of accurately arranged concrete districts, subdivided by straight tarmaced lines and <a href="#seemingly_sleek">seemingly sleek</a> concrete walls. With sticky city traffic stopping and going between blocks and buildings, a <a href="#viscous_flow">viscous flow</a> or a stream, <a href="#paketzentrum47">transport system</a>, <a href="#networks">water system, communication or media network, power network, the world wide web</a>... diverse movements that divide and connect people. As we start listening to its rhythms, structures, bodies, vibrations, its sound, we discover that <a href="#the_city_sounds">the city is crowded to overflowing</a> with sonic information and thus <a href="#cause_and_purpose">cause and purpose both of and for a future auditive information system</a>. Though futuristic this may sound, it is not the ever advancing, hyper engineered, super efficient vision of what's to come but the idea of advancing backward and in all directions: This future is an ocean and we are navigating on it now. Going nowhere and yet&mdash;in circles&mdash;or is it spirals&mdash;getting everywhere on our <a href="#rafts">raft made of plastic bottles</a> or as we call them: re-invented wheels. And there is really nothing else to do, no meaningful machine to bow to and work for, just a wasteland of time. We are gambling away our time playing (cards, <a href="#ever_tried">instruments, programming, tinkering, soldering , cooking, doing stuff outdoors, listening&hellip; listening real hard&hellip; and again programming&hellip;</a>) and all the playing really gets us thinking about how time is all you need and unpayable, not with money at any rate. If we needed money, we'd invented it ourselves by now. But we don't, we invent other stuff, ideas that can be spread and things that <a href="#can_be_shared">can be shared</a>. We don't want to protect our ideas. We believe in the importance of being in contact with and open for others as well as ourselves, in making new and old friends and in watching slide shows that show slides none of us knows, we can make up a whole new meaning for them, construct worlds that never existed but are based on our shared experience of watching flat pictures developed on razor-thin glass that beg for being shattered, to burst into a thousand sounds, then recombined, stacked, making up new sense or no sense at all, ever more obscuring this world we made up. Until</p>
