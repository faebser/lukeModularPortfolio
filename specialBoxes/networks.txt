<p>We rely on transportation, food supply chains, the internet, the media, all kind of industries, all the machines that we have unleashed. Their information sequences and digital transactions go far beyond our perception. However a muffled pumping remains... a <a href="#paketzentrum47">rhythmic throb</a>, a constant vibration, a subtle whir, a fizzing around, a piercing shriek. Once we stop ignoring it, it all comes crashing down about our ears. Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Over and over again iterating the collapse. We force the pace to constantly accelerate, speeding up the process, sabotaging our goods, our organs, our systems, forcing them to become obsolete, initiating self-destruction.<br>
We root out every secret that is not rooted deep enough and unfold it to the blazing sun, to scorching criticism, to dry out each and every fact, knowing that we will reincarnate as rhizomes in multidimensional space, feeling that we have become aliens. </p>
