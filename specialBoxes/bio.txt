<p>Lukas Truniger is a musician, sound designer and sound artist.
Born in Z&uuml;rich in 1986, he has studied at <em>Institue For Music And Media</em> at the <em>Robert Schumann School of Music</em>, D&uuml;sseldorf since 2008.<br>
He works in the areas of live music, installations, film sound and the creation of new instruments. Characteristic of his work is an alteration between different worlds and the ambition to confront, combine, scramble and rearrange them: experimental music and club-context, DIY and pre-manufactured, sound and image, contemporary and classical, ambient and peak-time, field recordings and digital sound generation&hellip;
Fascinated by self-made code and circuits, hacked instruments, misused tools, network processes and concepts of multi-dimensionalism; these components have become crucial to his work. </p>
