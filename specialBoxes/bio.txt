	<p>Lukas Truniger,<br>
	was born in Zürich in 1986. Since 2008, he studies at the <em>Institut Fuer Musik Und Medien</em> of the <em>Robert Schumann Hochschule Düsseldorf</em>. As a musician, sounddesigner and sound artist, his tasks includes live music, installations, creating new instruments and filmsound. Facinated by DIY, the use of selfmade code, hacked instruments and missused tools is crucial in his work.<br>
	He is always searching for new sound in the environment as well as in the digital domain, confronted by the insufficiency of the even and he therefore epands his search on multisensorism and multidimensionalsim.<br>
	Tipically he is working between different worlds, sonic and visual, experimental and club-context, amient and peak-time, diy and manufactured, contemprary and classical, ambitious to combine, rearrange and scramble these worlds.
