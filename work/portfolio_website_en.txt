<h1>Portfolio Website (2013)</h1>
<p>Virtual object</p>
<br>
<p>My portfolio website was made by Svenja Voﬂ (design), Katharina Hauke (text) and Fabian Frei (programming). We worked with different concepts: the content is visually organized on a map; there are feedback loops and a lot of cross reverences in the text; the programmation is very slick and home brewed.</p>
