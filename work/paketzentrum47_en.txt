<h1>Paketzentrum47 (2011)</h1>
<p>audiovisual installation</p>
<br>
<p>This sound sculpture broaches the issue of transportation routes, distances and packaging of electrical entertainment goods.
<br>
Both the sound and the video material stem from a recording made by devices that were sent by post for 12 hours, recording during the whole time of transportation. Digital pictures showing the raw material the electric devices are made of are added to the visuals. 
The respective packages used for the installation are not transported to the location since they are already there. Which makes it both site specific and all-site suitable but is also an examination of every artifacts omni-present, aparently invisible covering (=transport packaging). 
<br>
Paperboard containers and other kinds of packaging provide projection screens for the pictures of them being transported. Likewise some of the cartons are used as speakers for the installations 8 audio channels, thereby shaping the sound and its spatialisation.</p>
<br>
<p>I developed Paketzentrum47 in the context of my studies at Institut Fuer Musik und Medien. The project was supervised by Hannes H&ouml;lzl, Andreas Kolinski, Prof. Julian Rohrhuber and Prof. Dr. Heike Sperling.</p>
