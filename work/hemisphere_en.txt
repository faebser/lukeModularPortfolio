<h1>Hemisphere (2011)</h1>
<p>Music/Sound Design</p>
<br>
<p>This short movie by Stephan Telaar approaches the conflict between raw emotions and rational thinking. Both for the image and the music, the golden ratio is used as a mathematical base for the generation of clusters, thus as the formal principle for the video as a whole.<br>
Image and sound have been developed in the Visual Music degree program at the Institut Fuer Musik Und Medien.</p>
