<h1>Br&egrave;ches d'une mechanique sonore (cracks in a sonic mechanism, 2012)</h1>
<p>audiovisual installation</p>
<br>
<p>This installation is an absurd sonic machine. It is a machine with a body, living
thanks to programmed rules, a life of function and production. The machine
produces different kinds of information: sonic, visual, digital and textual, passing
them between its organs. And it discharges them through its different
outputs. In this stream of information, it generates errors. It is an efficient error-machine with a
desire for errors. The machine is a desiring machine.</p>
<br>
<p>The installation was developped together with Ali Tnani (TU).</p>
