<h1>Br&egrave;ches d'une Mechanique sonore (cracks in a sonic mechanism, 2012)</h1>
<p>Audiovisual Installation</p>
<br>
<p>This absurd sonic machine has a body and is living a life of tasks and production, due to programmed rules. The machine manufactures different kinds of information: sonic, visual, digital and textual, passing them between its organs and discharging them through its different outputs. Within this stream of information, it generates errors so that it can also be referred to as an efficient error-machine.<br>
The installation was developed together with <a href="http://alitnani.com/" target="_blank">Ali Tnani</a>.</p>
