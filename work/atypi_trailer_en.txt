<h1>AtypI Trailer (2012)</h1>
<p>music/sound design</p>
<br>
<p>Fractal particles that do not match together. Sequences are following bluntly. Like the consequences of a story. Time brings elucidation, exchange and consistancy. Latin and Chinese script worlds blend into new forms and gestures. A notion?</p>

<p>This clip was developed as an opening trailer for the AtypI Converence 2012 in Honkong. Animation by Svenja Voss.</p>
