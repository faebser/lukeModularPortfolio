<h1>Die Theorie des Himmels (The Theory of the Sky, 2011)</h1>
<p>Live electronics/Sonic concept</p>
<br>
<p>This sound performance works with the sounds of classical instruments as well as with electronic noises inside the spatial conditions of the KIT (Kunst im Tunnel, an exhibition space in D&uuml;sseldorf), which happens to be the relict of a highway tunnel.<br>
The performance is composed as a piece for two violins, cello, harp and electronics. The piece was developed by Mischa Tangian for the exhibition.
