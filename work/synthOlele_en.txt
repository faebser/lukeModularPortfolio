<h1>synthOlele (2012)</h1>
<p>Development of instrument/Live electronics</p>
<br>
<p>The <em>synthOlele</em> is a digital instrument. It combines several elements for the control of synthesized sound hence working as an interface. There is a certain resemblance to a traditional ukulele. This is not a coincidence but strict plagiarism aiming for the synthOlele to become the ukuleles' electronic cover-version.<br>
The synthOlele was developed in collaboration with industrial designer Dominik Noli.</p>
