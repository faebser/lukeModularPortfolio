<h1>Moving Type (2012)</h1>
<p>music/sound design</p>
<br>
<p>Scoring of  33 abstract short films showing experimental animation of typography. Sound and  image work on different concepts and non-concepts processing a great variety of analog/manual and digital techniques and materials. The sound design is based on the image using a wide range of approaches such as: associative scoring of the videos, use of hazardous material, on-camera recordings, data extracted from the pictures by measuring or approximation, converted directly into sound... The compositions are built up of live-recorded instruments both real and virtual alongside generated noises and field-recordings.

<p>The videos were developed by Svenja Voss as her bachelor-thesis. Svenja lives and works as a designer in D&uuml;sseldorf.</p>
